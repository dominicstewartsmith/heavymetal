# heavymetal

This project was my first full-stack Javascript application, a simple no-frills gym workout logger.
It uses an Express server, a MongoDB database (using mongoose as an ORM), and React with Javascript for the front-end.

I wrote this because the majority of apps in this category are either subscription based, or bloated with features I personall have no need for.
Heavymetal is straight to the point, and achieves the intended functionality.
